# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

First Come First Serve (FCFS) <br>
Shortest Job First (SJF) <br>
Priority Algorithm (Prio) <br>
Deadline Scheduling Algorithm <br>
Preemptive Priority Algorithm (P-Prio) <br>
Shortest Remaining Time First Algorithm (SRTF) <br> 
Round Robin Algorithm (RR) <br>

- by clicking the "Add" button, a default Job object 
will be created. 

- the "Save" button is used to save the changes 
made to the details of the Job.

- you can delete the Job by clicking 
the "Delete" button.

- after choosing the algorithm and having 
the job details all set, click "Run" to solve 
and compute for the turnaround time and
waiting time. A gantt chart will also be 
displayed at the top.
